# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Start by creating a new Vite project if you donâ€™t have one set up already. The most common approach is to use Create Vite.
npm create vite@latest
project name  vite-project
  cd vite-project
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer


npx tailwindcss init -p
